Sound Ocean provides a unique interactive music discovery experience by allowing the user to first choose a genre and then "swim through the ocean of sound," discovering songs streaming from the SoundCloud API. The user can save songs to a playlist and compete with friends for the most songs discovered. Three people worked on the project. I contributed the interactive visual elements as well as integrating with the SoundCloud API, the bulk of which was completed in one week.
