[Disappointed Man]({{page.website}}) is a less morbid reimagining of the classic [hangman game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_%28game%29). Basically you guess a letter using the keyboard. If you guess correctly, the letter is filled in. If you guess incorrectly, the picture of me becomes increasingly more disappointed.

Disappointed Man was built for a class assignment at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/) and is implemented in pure Javascript with no jQuery or other dependancies. Not to hate on third-party libraries, but that was the assignment. Stay tuned for a more mobile friendly version that may or may not use [ServiceWorkers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) to be available offline.
