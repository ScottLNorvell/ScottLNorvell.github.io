An abstract game of beautiful designs, [{{page.title}}]({{page.website}}) challenges you to click on the blue circle without getting hit by the red circle. 

As you move the mouse, the red circle follows. When you click the blue circle, it mutates the blue blob. The trick is to see how many times you can click the blue cicle without getting touched by the red circle. Don't worry, we're not keeping score...
