talk about how my team built a Ember 1.7 app and how things have changed

link to post mortem talk

things are more succinct

what is it? a view? a compontent? do I render it in an outlet? 

MOST of the time? It's a component

Where do I put my logic? my computed props? The View? The Controller? What's a service?

Answer Unless it's a query param

query params => controller

singleton/long-lived state => service

"decorations", actions, extra state => component

so this: (show confusing controller, view, template etc logic)
becomes this: (show)

We're almost done! How do we do animations? 

#### 1.7 => o shit! maybe we just skip it
(show ugly animation)
#### 1.? and on => liquid fire
(show sexy animation)

#### Talk about Integration Tests
(figure them out..)
