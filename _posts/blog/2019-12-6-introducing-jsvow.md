A while ago I had a really silly idea to teach JavaScript and Vocabulary in one wacky blog series. Hence JS VOW (**J**ava**S**cript **V**ariable of the **W**eek) was born.

You can see the results [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/jsvow).

<h2>JavaScript Variable of the Week</h2>
<div class="jsvow-slogan">
  <p>Teaching JavaScript through vocabulary...</p>
  <p>or vocabulary through JavaScript...</p>
  <p>(or maybe neither)</p>
</div>

> (Full disclosure: there probably won't be one per week.)
