```js
const foist = (obj, upon = globalThis) => {
  Object.entries(obj).forEach(
    ([key, value]) =>
      Object.defineProperty(upon, key, {
        value,
        writable: false, // :D
      })
  );
};
```

_Usage:_

```js
foist({ jsvow: 'great' });

console.log('jsvow is', jsvow);
// logs "jsvow is great"
```

_Abusage:_

```js
// Browser
foist({ jQuery: 'http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/' });

window.jQuery = actualJQuery;
// throws an error in strict mode :D

foist({ random: () => 0.5 }, Math);

Math.random();
// always returns 0.5! (not so random...)

// Node
foist({ setTimeout: "don't actually do this!" });

setTimeout(doSomething, 100);
// throws an error (in ANY mode)
```

### Try it out!
You can play around with `foist` if you open the JavaScript console on this page. You'll see a friendly message and you can run something like the following:

```js
> JSVOW.foist({ foisting: 'awesome' })
// undefined
> foisting
// 'awesome'
```

## Thoughts
I wanted to start this series off with `foist` because I think `foist` has the potential to become part of the officially recognized JavaScript vernacular. I mean, it rhymes with another established JavaScript term ([hoist](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting)) and foisting is a concept that already exists in JavaScript. Consider the following code:

```js
function logSomeThings(a, b) {
  var thingA = "here is thingA: " + a;
  thingB = "here is thingB: " + b;
  console.log(thingA, thingB);
}
```

If you run `logSomeThings` anywhere in the browser, you will be able to access `window.thingB` anywhere _else_ in the browser. Basically, if you forget to declare a variable in a function, it gets `foist` upon the window object. Many would argue that this "feature" belongs in **JavaScript: The Bad Parts**.

> DISCLAIMER: ðŸ¤” Ok, so maybe don't actually use this foist function.

Nowadays, we can use [`let`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) and [`const`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/statements/const) to be more explicit about the scope of our variables.

> FUN FACT: with [`let`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) and [`const`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/statements/const), your variables are neither foisted _nor_ hoisted!

So the next time you are doing a code review and you come across an example like `logSomeThings` above, you can make a comment like, "Looks like you are foisting `thingB`. Consider revising."

Maybe it will catch on?

### * `globalThis` * <- What's that?

It's a **[shiny new feature](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/globalThis)**!

One goal of the JSVOW series is to try to introduce new features in a fun way. Without `globalThis`, it can get pretty messy to find the global object in different JavaScript environments. The global object is called `window` in the browser, `global` in node, `self` in workers and kind of doesn't exist in modules. `globalThis` lets us assign things globally in an environment-agnostic way.

We can do this:

```js
globalThis.value = 'my cool value';
```

Instead of this:

```js
const getGlobal = function () {
  if (typeof self !== 'undefined') { return self; }
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') { return window; }
  if (typeof global !== 'undefined') { return global; }
  throw new Error('unable to locate global object');
};

const oneGlobalToRuleThemAll = getGlobal();

oneGlobalToRuleThemAll.value = 'my cool value';
```

#### Why?

It's nice to be able to write an incredibly useful utility (like [`foist`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/foist)) and have some confidence it will run in all JavaScript environments. This  is called [Isomorphic JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic_JavaScript). There are a lot of other things to consider when writing Isomorphic JavaScript, but `globalThis` provides an elegant solution to the consideration accessing the global object.

## Install

You can foist (with caution) in your own projects by installing [`foist` from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/foist):

```sh
npm install foist
```

And in your code:

```js
import foist from 'foist';

foist({ window: 'not the window' });
// fortunately this doesn't work :D
```

> NOTE: `foist` is only compatible with new versions of Chrome and Firefox and Node >=12 or so.
