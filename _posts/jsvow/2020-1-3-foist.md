## Thoughts
I wanted to start off this series with **foist** because I think it has the potential to actually becoming part of the JavaScript vernacular. It rhymes with [hoist](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting) and I feel like foisting as a concept already exists in JavaScript. Consider the following code:

```js
function logSomeThings(a, b) {
  var thingA = "here is thingA: " + a;
  thingB = "here is thingB: " + b;
  console.log(thingA, thingB);
}
```

In the days before `const` and `let`, all we had was `var`. If you forget to declare a variable in a function, it gets _foist_ upon the window object. Many argue this "feature" belongs in **JavaScript: The Bad Parts**.

> DISCLAIMER: Ok, so maybe don't actually use this foist function.

Anyway, let's start small. The next time you are doing a code review and you come across an example like this, you can say, "I think you're foisting here." Maybe it will catch on?

### Try it out!
You can play around with `foist` if you open up the JavaScript console. You'll see a friendly message and then you can run:

```js
> JSVOW.foist({ foisting: 'awesome' })
// undefined
> foisting
// 'awesome'
```

You can also foist (with caution) in your own projects by installing it from npm:

```sh
npm install foist
```

And in your code:

```js
import foist from 'foist';

foist({ window: 'not the window' });
// fortunately this doesn't work :D
```
