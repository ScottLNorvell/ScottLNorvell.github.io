```js
const foist = (obj, upon = globalThis) => {
  Object.entries(obj).forEach(
    ([key, value]) =>
      Object.defineProperty(upon, key, {
        value,
        writable: false,
      })
  );
};
```

_Usage_

```js
foist({ jsvow: 'great' });

console.log('jsvow is', jsvow);
// logs "jsvow is great"
```

_Abusage_

```js
// Browser
foist({ jQuery: 'http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/' });

window.jQuery = actualJQuery;
// throws an error in strict mode :D

foist({ random: () => 0.5 }, Math);

Math.random();
// always returns 0.5! (not so random)

// Node
foist({ setTimeout: "don't actually do this!" });

setTimeout(doSomething, 100);
// throws an error (in ANY mode)
```

## Thoughts
I wanted to start off this series with `foist` because I think it has the potential to actually become part of the JavaScript vernacular. It rhymes with [hoist](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting) (an established JavaScript term) and I would contend that foisting as a concept already exists in JavaScript. Consider the following code:

```js
function logSomeThings(a, b) {
  var thingA = "here is thingA: " + a;
  thingB = "here is thingB: " + b;
  console.log(thingA, thingB);
}
```

If you forget to declare a variable in a function, it gets _foist_ upon the window object. Many argue this "feature" belongs in **JavaScript: The Bad Parts**. Nowadays, we can use `let` and `const` to be more explicit about the scope of our variables.

> DISCLAIMER: ðŸ¤” Ok, so maybe don't actually use this foist function.

The next time you are doing a code review and you come across an example like this, you can say, "You're foisting here. Consider revising." Maybe it will catch on?

### Try it out!
You can play around with `foist` if you open up the JavaScript console on this page. You'll see a friendly message and you can run something like the following:

```js
> JSVOW.foist({ foisting: 'awesome' })
// undefined
> foisting
// 'awesome'
```

You can also foist (with caution) in your own projects by installing [`foist` from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/foist):

```sh
npm install foist
```

And in your code:

```js
import foist from 'foist';

foist({ window: 'not the window' });
// fortunately this doesn't work :D
```

> NOTE: `foist` is only compatible with new versions of Chrome and Firefox and Node >=12 or so.

### * `globalThis` * <- What's that?

It's a [shiny new feature](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/globalThis)! One goal of the JSVOW series is to introduce new features in a fun way. It can get pretty messy to find the global object in different JavaScript environments. It is `window` in the browser, `global` in node, `self` in workers and kind of doesn't exist in modules. `globalThis` lets us assign things globally in an environment-agnostic way.

We can do this:

```js
globalThis.value = 'my cool value';
```

Instead of this:

```js
const getGlobal = function () {
  if (typeof self !== 'undefined') { return self; }
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') { return window; }
  if (typeof global !== 'undefined') { return global; }
  throw new Error('unable to locate global object');
};

const oneGlobalToRuleThemAll = getGlobal();

oneGlobalToRuleThemAll.value = 'my cool value';
```

#### Why?

It's nice to be able to write an incredibly useful utility (like [`foist`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/foist)) and have some confidence it will run in all JavaScript environments. This  is called [Isomorphic JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic_JavaScript). There are a lot of things to consider when writing Isomorphic JavaScript. `globalThis` provides an elegant solution to the consideration of how to access the global object.
