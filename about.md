### More About Me

I am obsessed with [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) and [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/). I also love databases like [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and working with [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) to create awesome apis to feed my frontend [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) applications.
